# TwitchGQL

Go module for Twitch's GraphQL API

Due to the scale of Twitch's GraphQL API, this does not support every single type since it would be a quasi-impossible task.

If you want to query a particular type which is not supported, feel free to create an issue or a pull request and I will implement it.
